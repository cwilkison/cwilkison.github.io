Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Cole Wilkison, I am a Full Stack Web Developer who attended Lambda School. I love programming projects, building new apps and learning about all things computers! When I'm not on my laptop you can find me out on a hike or cooking up some vegan food. Currently I am involved in personal projects and freelance work.

I was born and raised in Charlotte, North Carolina and currently live here as well. After finishing Lambda School I am hoping for work in the Charlotte area. I love living here and make a great team member to any project. Please checkout my repositories and feel free to contact me at wilkison.cole@gmail.com.

I am confident in the following skills: HTML, CSS, Python, Node, React, Redux, JavaScript, Postman, SQL, Git, Unit Testing and Deployment.

I am interested and still learning: Alogrithms, Data Structures, OOP and writing maintainable code.
